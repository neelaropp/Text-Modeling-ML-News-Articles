README: NLP and Topic Modeling on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset
Understanding and analyzing textual data is a fundamental challenge in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in extracting meaningful insights from large, unstructured text datasets. This project explores various text-processing techniques using the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a well-known collection of articles spanning 20 different topics. The objective was to preprocess the text, extract meaningful features, model underlying topics, and analyze document similarity using word embeddings. These techniques are essential for applications in news categorization, sentiment analysis, search optimization, and content recommendation systems.

Our analysis began with text preprocessing, where we tokenized the text, removed noise such as punctuation and stopwords, and applied lemmatization to normalize words. This preprocessing step significantly reduced the complexity of our data while retaining its core meaning. Following this, we transformed our text into numerical representations using the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model, which converts text into frequency-based feature vectors. To enhance the model’s ability to capture context, we extended BoW by including bigrams, allowing us to account for common word pairs, such as “machine learning” or “data science.” The inclusion of bigrams notably increased our vocabulary size and improved our representation of the text.

We then performed topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify underlying themes in the dataset. By setting the number of topics to 10, we were able to extract distinct topics such as technology discussions, religious debates, and political discussions, among others. The results highlighted the ability of LDA to group semantically related words, providing a deeper understanding of the dataset’s structure. Each topic was characterized by a set of frequently occurring words, making it possible to interpret and classify different text samples.

To go beyond traditional frequency-based representations, we utilized GloVe word embeddings, a pre-trained model that captures the semantic meaning of words. By computing document embeddings through the average of word vectors, we were able to create a richer, context-aware representation of each document. These embeddings allowed us to measure document similarity using cosine similarity, identifying which articles were most alike in terms of content and meaning. The results showed that documents discussing similar subjects—such as different programming languages or varying religious ideologies—had higher similarity scores, validating the effectiveness of word embeddings in understanding textual relationships.

In summary, this project demonstrated the power of NLP techniques in transforming raw text into structured, meaningful representations. We observed that bigrams improved contextual understanding in BoW, LDA effectively uncovered thematic structures in text, and GloVe embeddings provided a more nuanced approach to measuring document similarity. These findings have broad implications, particularly in automated document classification, search optimization, and recommendation systems. Future improvements could include incorporating deep learning models such as BERT for richer text representations and visualizing topic distributions using interactive tools like pyLDAvis. The insights gained from this project reinforce the value of NLP in making sense of large-scale textual data and provide a strong foundation for further exploration in machine learning and text analytics.
